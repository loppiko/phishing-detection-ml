    "#### XGBoost\n",
    "The XGBoost model turned out to be a **highly accurate model**, but unfortunately, it requires **intensive preprocessing of the input data** and a **long training time**. Due to the very long training times, hardware limitations, and the need for intensive data processing to create the TF-IDF matrix, **this model was trained on a small fragment of the dataset** (between 4,000 and 32,000 records depending on the selected model type). However, it still achieved relatively good results, particularly when combining more specialized models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LSTM\n",
    "The LSTM model turned out to be by far the **best choice** in terms of classification, both regarding **final accuracy** and **fast input data processing and training**. This model utilized a combination of different columns into one, which contained all the necessary data, eliminating the need to combine various models into one. Due to **low hardware requirements**, it was the only model that was successfully trained on the **full dataset** (64,000 records).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BERT\n",
    "As a transformer, this model had the **highest hardware requirements** of all models, and for this reason, **model training** was **complex and time-consuming**. Unfortunately, it **did not achieve satisfactory results** (the model continuously predicted one class) and did not respond to either oversampling or class weights.\n"

    "### XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model, an approach was implemented that focused on creating several independent models that categorized data based on different parameters (in this case, columns - 'body', 'subject', 'sender', and 'receiver').\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Body Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The body model contained the content of the email, which had the most data, making it possible to train the model on **only a small fragment of the dataset (4,000 records)**. The best model achieved an accuracy of 89.67% (as shown in the next graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop Words vs Without Stop Words\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing two body models (with and without stop words), it turned out that **the model that removed stop words performed slightly better**, although the difference was within the margin of error (shown on the left side of the confusion matrix with stop words and on the right side without stop words).\n",

    "#### Subject Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the subject usually contains much less data than the email body, it was possible to train the model on a significantly larger data sample (16,000 records). However, the accuracy of recognizing messages based on the subject remained lower at approximately 78.67%.\n",

    "Training LSTM models differed from training XGBoost models. LSTM models were not divided into smaller parts (classification based on different columns was carried out by a single model), and instead, additional data were \"attached.\" **Training** was significantly faster than for other models, and as a result, **the models were trained on the full dataset** (64,000 records).\n",

    "\n",

    "**Stop words** allow the **LSTM model** to **understand context faster**, leading to **faster training**. The model using stop words achieved satisfactory results much faster than the one without stop words (comparisons were made for 35 epochs, while the model without stop words started to show results around the 42-44 epoch). Despite the limited number of epochs, the LSTM model with stop words started to train more quickly.\n",

    "#### Subject Model\n",
    "Each subsequent model uses transformed input data by appending new information (such as subject or domain). Unfortunately, no model proved to be significantly better than the base model.

    "### BERT\n",
    "For the BERT model, two types of models were tested (both with and without stop words), but no satisfactory results were achieved for either. Various configurations were tested, including oversampling, adjusting weights for different classes, expanding the dataset fragment (from 1,000 to 16,000 samples), different padding options, and varying maximum text lengths (from 64 to 512 characters). Due to hardware limitations, a relatively small batch size (8) was used, which might also have impacted the final result. No difference was noticed between models with or without stop words, as both models consistently predicted one class.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Models respond well to task division and creating clusters of specialized models, where each model evaluates a record based on different data. This approach leads to noticeable improvements in accuracy and other metrics.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "- When a single model evaluates data based on a specific column, it does not yield positive results, and in some cases, it even worsens the outcome (the best approach is one data type - one model).\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "- The LSTM model performs best regarding both training time and final metrics.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "- No correlation was found, nor disproven, between the credibility of the message and whether the domains of the sender and receiver match.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "- The decision to remove stop words or keep them depends on the needs of the specific model. For instance, for the LSTM model, which tries to understand context, this can be crucial, while for other models, such as XGBoost, removing stop words may yield better results.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "- Despite its long training process due to the need to convert data into a TF-IDF matrix and the size of the matrix, the XGBoost model can achieve relatively good results on a much smaller data sample, making it a potentially good\n"
